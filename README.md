# Task-List
 This is List making app. UI designed with the help of Framework "Materialise" and functionality is done by javascript. The storing of data is being done in localStorage of the user system. The concept of localStorage like getting the data from local storage, setting the data to the localStorage, and deleting the data from localStorage is covered in this project. Your data will be deleted only once in this list-making app. Once you refresh your page or come back to your page, the remove button will not be visible. Only the Clear button will work to clear all the list items.  Thank you. Happy Codding :)
